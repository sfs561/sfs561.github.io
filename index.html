    <h2>Blog and learning notes</h2>
   
    <p>
      I use this section to write short explanations of ideas from computer architecture,
      databases, and other modules, so I remember them and can show my understanding.

      <h3>What is a CPU cache? (short explanation)</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        A CPU cache is a small, very fast type of memory inside the processor. 
        It stores copies of data that the CPU uses often, so the CPU does not
        have to wait for slower main memory (RAM). This makes programs run faster.

      <h3>Intro to normalisation in databases</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        Normalisation is the process of organising tables in a database so that 
        each table focuses on one topic and there is minimal duplicated data.
        This helps keep the data consistent and easier to maintain.

  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
  <p>
    This week I worked on my GitHub Pages portfolio website. I focused on
    creating or improving the main sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
    and changing the design of my page by using a css file.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am most happy with being able to successfully create my new repository on github and starting to use my HTML knowledge in a real example. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I found it difficult to find creative ways to improve my website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time I want to improve my website by adding different pages.
