    <h2>Blog and learning notes</h2>
   
    <p>
      I use this section to write short explanations of ideas from computer architecture,
      databases, and other modules, so I remember them and can show my understanding.

      <h3>What is a CPU cache? (short explanation)</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        A CPU cache is a small, very fast type of memory inside the processor. 
        It stores copies of data that the CPU uses often, so the CPU does not
        have to wait for slower main memory (RAM). This makes programs run faster.

      <h3>Intro to normalisation in databases</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        Normalisation is the process of organising tables in a database so that 
        each table focuses on one topic and there is minimal duplicated data.
        This helps keep the data consistent and easier to maintain.

  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
  <p>
    This week I worked on my GitHub Pages portfolio website. I focused on
    creating or improving the main sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
    and changing the design of my page by using a css file.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am most happy with being able to successfully create my new repository on github and starting to use my HTML knowledge in a real example. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I found it difficult to find creative ways to improve my website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time I want to improve my website by adding different pages.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 14 February 2026</p>
  <p><strong>
    1. What did you actually build or change this week?</strong></p>
  <p>This week, I worked on developing my personal website by improving its structure and content. 
    I added an About Me section that clearly introduces who I am and what I study, and I also created a basic Projects section.
    And there is a blog section and pruduction diary. I also used a sample CSS file to improve the visual design of the website.</p>
  <p><strong>
    2. Which achievement are you most proud of so far on your website?</strong></p>
  <p>I am most proud of the progress I made in understanding how different parts of the website work together, especially how applying CSS improved the visual appearance and made the site more readable and organised, even though it is still simple.</p>
  <p><strong>
    3. What did you find most challenging?</strong></p>
  <p>
    The most challenging part was understanding the HTML structure and how it connects with the CSS file. I also found using GitHub challenging at first, especially committing and pushing updates without mistakes.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    4. What did you learn about web development or computer science maths from this work?
</strong></p>
  <p>I learned how basic HTML elements affect the layout of a website, including how headings, sections, and containers organise content and improve readability.</p>
  <p><strong>
    5. What is one concrete improvement you want to make next week?
</strong></p>
  <p>Next week, I want to add more pages to my website, especially the maths part.</p>
